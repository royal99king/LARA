Level Acknowledging &amp; Real-time Alerting

Natural disasters are coming day by day and in India we are not have effective technologies or systems to control these catastrophes. One of such disasters is flood and here we are presenting a system that can alert when conditions for flood will be there, itâ€™s a cloud based technology which posts on social media when there will be a situation like flood.

Project is on thingspeak and ibm cloud.
